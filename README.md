# Automation test for forms in CloudQA

Link to the tested website : https://app.cloudqa.io/home/AutomationPracticeForm

The website included multiple forms with different senarios to be tested.

So, I chose a few to be tested in general,
 - a normal form
 - an iframe with a form in it (without id)
 - an iframe with a form in it (with id)
 - an iframe with shadow form in it
 - a deep shadow form with nested shadw elements (I chose 5 level one to test)
